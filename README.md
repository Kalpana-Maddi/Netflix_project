# Netflix_project

This project explores Netflixâ€™s content library to uncover trends in movies and TV shows. Using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), the analysis covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization to identify popular genres, release year trends, top contributing countries, and key creators. Insights are paired with recommendations to help guide strategic content decisions.
